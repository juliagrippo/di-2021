Final: Hybrid Time/Date Clock

This clock makes use of the following retinal variables: position, orientation, hue, value, and size to tell time. 

The three main, orbital-like rings depict seconds, hours, and minutes to lay the foundation for telling clock-based time. The outer most ring depicts seconds, the middle ring depicts minutes, and the smallest ring (closest to the center) depicts hours. The circles placed on each of these lines respectively depicts seconds, minutes, and hours as each circle completes a full 360 rotation. The size of each circle helps to differentiate between variables of time. In addition, the value/hue of each circle shifts as we approach noon and midnight. Therefore, creating a gradient effect across the 24 hour display. 

The 7 rectangles that are seen horizontally on the canvas represent the day. Each day has its own color which is meant to tell the viewer if it is Monday, Tuesday, etc dependant on hue. In addition, these rectangles move from the top of the canvas to the bottom of the canvas to depict the progression of the month. The top of the screen represents the beginning of the month and the bottom of the canvas is the end of the month. Therefore, this portion of the design relies upon position to depict date. In doing this, the entire canvas becomes a metaphor for the month.

The color of the background shifts each month. Therefore, each month has been assigned its own color. This shift acts as a gradient between colors as the months transition into one another. It helps to solidify the relationship between the rectangles representing date and the canvas itself representing the month.

The four squares positioned at the top left corner of the canvas represent season. Visually, their organization is supposed to represent a window - as if you were to watch the seasons pass as you look out the window. Each of the four seasons have been given a defined color. Therefore, each season will display its own color.

Lastly, the thin rectangle, which lays upon the outer most circle, depicts season. Therefore, its color matches that of the four squares in the upper left corner. However, this portion differs in that its orientation and position is relative to the positioning of the moon during the equinox of each season.
