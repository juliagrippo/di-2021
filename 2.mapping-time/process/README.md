Julia Grippo Ideas:

Idea #1: Planets orbiting
Concept: 3 planets will orbit in a circular pattern. Each planet will represent one of the factors of time. The largest ring will be hours, the middle ring will be minutes, and the smallest ring will be seconds. The position of the planet in correlation to the ring will determine the time. Other retinal variables that can be explored are changes in hue and value. The size of each ring will also be different which will help in differentiating between variables. As the planets orbit, they can change hue and/or value to depict the passing of time.

Idea #2: Clouds
Concept: My second idea is to have three clouds move across the screen. Each cloud will represent a different variable of time. The clouds will rely on position, hue, and size to differentiate themselves. Each second, the highest cloud on the screen (which represents seconds) will tick across the screen in a horizontal motion. Each minute, the cloud positioned at the middle of the screen will move across the screen in a horizontal direction. Each hour, the cloud positioned lowest will also move across the screen in a horizontal position. As the day progresses, the colors of the clouds will change to reflect the sky getting darker. Each cloud will also have a distinct size to differentiate them while also creating a sense of depth on the canvas. 

Idea #3: Minimal Shapes
Concept: My third idea is to give each element of time it’s own distinctive shape. Seconds will be represented by a diamond that changes value each second. Hours will be represented by an elongated rectangle that changes its orientation each hour. Minutes will be represented by a circle that changes hue each minute. 

Idea #4: Overlapping Squares
There will be three squares aligned on top of one another and aligned to the center of the screen. The clock will use the retinal variable, size, to tell time. Each second, minute, and hour, each square will change value. The gradient from white to black depicts the spectrum of 0-60 seconds, 0-60 minutes, and 0-24 hours. The largest square is seconds, the middle sized square is minutes, and the smallest square is hours.

Idea #5: Position of Dots
There will be three dots on the screen. They will all move horizontally across the screen, utilizing the retinal variable, position, to tell time. Every second, the dot closest to the top of the screen (seconds) will move to the right. The second dot (minutes), aligned to the middle of the screen, will also move horizontally each minute. Lastly, the third dot, closest to the bottom of the page (hours), will also move horizontally across the screen. The colors of the circles will change on a 24 hour cycle. The colors will change according to a red to blue gradient. The gradient from blue to red depicts the spectrum of 0-60 seconds, 0-60 minutes, and 0-24 hours.

Idea #6: Orientation of 3 Elongated rectangles 
Three elongated rectangles will be aligned to the center of the screen. Each rectangle will take on a different length with the hour hand being the longest. This clock will rely on the retinal variable, orientation, to tell time. Each rectangle will rotate in regards to the unit of time that it is measuring. 0-360° will represent 0-60 seconds, 0-60 minutes, and 0-24 hours. The colors will change according to a red to blue gradient. The gradient from blue to red depicts the spectrum of 0-60 seconds, 0-60 minutes, and 0-24 hours.
