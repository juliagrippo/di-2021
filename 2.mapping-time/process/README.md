Julia Grippo Ideas:

Idea #1: Planets orbiting
Concept: 3 planets will orbit in a circular pattern. Each planet will represent one of the factors of time. The largest ring will be hours, the middle ring will be minutes, and the smallest ring will be seconds. The position of the planet in correlation to the ring will determine the time. Other retinal variables that can be explored are changes in hue and value. The size of each ring will also be different which will help in differentiating between variables. As the planets orbit, they can change hue and/or value to depict the passing of time.

Idea #2: Clouds
Concept: My second idea is to have three clouds move across the screen. Each cloud will represent a different variable of time. The clouds will rely on position, hue, and size to differentiate themselves. Each second, the highest cloud on the screen (which represents seconds) will tick across the screen in a horizontal motion. Each minute, the cloud positioned at the middle of the screen will move across the screen in a horizontal direction. Each hour, the cloud positioned lowest will also move across the screen in a horizontal position. As the day progresses, the colors of the clouds will change to reflect the sky getting darker. Each cloud will also have a distinct size to differentiate them while also creating a sense of depth on the canvas. 

Idea #3: Minimal Shapes
Concept: My third idea is to give each element of time it’s own distinctive shape. Seconds will be represented by a diamond that changes value each second. Hours will be represented by an elongated rectangle that changes its orientation each hour. Minutes will be represented by a circle that changes hue each minute. 

Idea #4: Overlapping Squares
There will be three squares aligned on top of one another and aligned to the center of the screen. The clock will use the retinal variable, size, to tell time. Each second, minute, and hour, each square will change value. The gradient from white to black depicts the spectrum of 0-60 seconds, 0-60 minutes, and 0-24 hours. The largest square is seconds, the middle sized square is minutes, and the smallest square is hours.

Idea #5: Position of Dots
There will be three dots on the screen. They will all move horizontally across the screen, utilizing the retinal variable, position, to tell time. Every second, the dot closest to the top of the screen (seconds) will move to the right. The second dot (minutes), aligned to the middle of the screen, will also move horizontally each minute. Lastly, the third dot, closest to the bottom of the page (hours), will also move horizontally across the screen. The colors of the circles will change on a 24 hour cycle. The colors will change according to a red to blue gradient. The gradient from blue to red depicts the spectrum of 0-60 seconds, 0-60 minutes, and 0-24 hours.

Idea #6: Orientation of 3 Elongated rectangles 
Three elongated rectangles will be aligned to the center of the screen. Each rectangle will take on a different length with the hour hand being the longest. This clock will rely on the retinal variable, orientation, to tell time. Each rectangle will rotate in regards to the unit of time that it is measuring. 0-360° will represent 0-60 seconds, 0-60 minutes, and 0-24 hours. The colors will change according to a red to blue gradient. The gradient from blue to red depicts the spectrum of 0-60 seconds, 0-60 minutes, and 0-24 hours.

Idea #7: 
The 7 rectangluar boxes represent the 7 days of the week. The darker, grayed-out boxes represent the other days of the week while the brightest box highlights the day of the week. The first box on the left represents Sunday. As you move to the right, the days increase by 1, therefore, depicting Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, etc. The position of this row of boxes indicates what day of the month it is. The top of the canvas represents day 1 of the month while the bottom of the canvas represents the max amount of days in the month (in this case, the max is 30 days). 

Idea #8:
The circle represents the moon's orbit. The rectangle mapped onto the circle represents the season. The rectangles have been positioned to correspond with the positon of the moon during each season's equinox. In this case, the orientation of the rectangle paired with its placement within the moon's orbit, helps to depict which season it is. Therefore, the placement of the rectangle is heavily tied to how the circle represents the moon's orbit. The circles also vary in size to show the distance that the moon is from Earth during that particular moment.

Idea #9: 
This concept represents season and year. The four squares use hue to depict which season it is. Each season is assigned a hue. The shape found in the top left corner of the top left square uses shape as its retinal variable to determine the year. Each year will have its own, distinguishable shape.
