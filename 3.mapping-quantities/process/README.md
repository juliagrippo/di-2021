Description of the contents of this folder, a prose description of your ideas for how to represent
the nuclear testing time series, and links to external data sources you'll be incorporating into
the project.

Overall Amount of Tests Per Country-2.svg
This graph uses percentages in a pie graph to depict the overall amount of tests per country. We can see that the US has more tests overall.

Overall Amount of Tests Per Country.svg
This uses a bar graph to show the overall amount of tests per country. We can see that the US has more tests overall.

Percentage of Types of Tests Overall.svg
We see that the overall amount of underground and atmospheric tests are pretty close, however, there are slightly more atmospheric tests conducted. Lab tests are the least used method.

Total Atmospheric Tests Per Country.svg
We see that the US has the most atmospheric tests conducted overall.

Total Number of Tests in Each Country.svg
This chart looks at the total number of tests in each country. We again see that the United States has the most tests with Russia having the second highest number of tests.

USA and Russia - Atmospheric and Underground.svg
This graph shoes that testing rose around the 1960s with atmospheric testing being more favorable.

USA Vs. Russia Total.svg 
When comparing atmospheric versus underground testing in the US and Russia, we see that both countires conducted more underground testing.

For the additional data source charts, I am interesting in finding a way to compare atmospheric testing in the US and Russia against the amount of cancer cases that appear in both countries following these tests. I am most interested possibly in lung cancer since I think that makes the most sense with atmospheric testing. 

Both sketches depict ways to combine line graphs (as a way of depicting time and the long-run) with a representation of atmospheric versus underground testing.
